# 03

Write a makefile that builds a static library and a program using
«automatic dependencies» (‹.d› files should be created during
compilation). Use libmath.a, along with the ‹math.c›
we had which used it. The name of the resulting program should be
‹math›. It should be possible to (at least) run ‹make libmath.a› and
‹make math›.
